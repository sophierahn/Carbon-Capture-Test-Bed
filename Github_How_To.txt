How to github

You enter the folder:

git pull

This updates the repo incase a collaborator has remotely altered the repo

When you're ready to apply your changes:
git add . 
This applies all changes you made, otherwise you could use:
git add <filename> to specify one altered file

Then commit your changes:
git commit

You'll be asked to submit some sort of comment on what you did

Finally, use 
git push

To check the status of where you are use:
git status

Remember, you'll committing the changes under Sophie's account
Theres nothing to be done on this point, just don't expect a generated
tag announcing it was you who made the change
